+ Integration test is defined as a type of testing where `software modules are integrated` logically and tested as a group. A typical software project consists of `multiple software modules`, coded by different programmers. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules when they are integrated

+ Integration test focuses mainly on the `interfaces & flow of data/information` between the modules. 

+ Approaches integration test with 3 way:
    + Big bang
    + Incremental Approach: which is further divided into the top-down or bottom-up approach

+ Incremental Approach is carried out by using `dummy programs` called Stubs and Drivers. Stubs and Drivers do not implement the entire programming logic of the software module but just simulate data communication with the calling module.
    + Stub: Is called by the Module under Test.
    + Driver: Calls the Module to be tested.

+ Integration Test Plans include the following attributes:
    + Methods/Approaches to testing (as discussed above).
    + Scopes and Out of Scopes Items of Integration Testing.
    + Roles and Responsibilities.
    + Pre-requisites for Integration testing.
    + Testing environment.
    + Risk and Mitigation Plans.
